Overview
--------

The Pre-FENS Brainhack is a lively event that brings together people who are passionate about open science, open-source tools, and collaboration around computational and systems neuroscience.
The hackathon provides an opportunity for people from different institutions to work together on projects of shared interest and learn from each other.

The 2026 edition of the Pre-FENS Brainhack will center on reproducibility in interpreting data within systems neuroscience, drawing inspiration from [CON²PHYS](https://mchini.github.io/con2phys/) — CONceptual CONsistency in electroPHYSiology.
During the Brainhack, participants will analyze the same electrophysiology dataset and attempt to answer multiple-choice questions that reflect real research challenges.
This setup aims to reveal how researchers deal with conceptual ambiguity and how their analytical choices affect outcomes.
The event fosters collaboration in teams of 3-4, integrating varied expertise and code practices to enhance reproducibility in analyses.
Read more about the concept [here](../con2phys).

In addition to hands-on work, Research Software Engineers (RSEs) will provide talks about current tools and practices in systems neuroscience, offering insights into making analyses more reproducible through cleaner code, 
standard data layouts, and effective testing practices.   

This hackathon is heavily inspired by the [Pre-COSYNE Brainhack](https://pre-cosyne-brainhack.github.io/hackathon2026/).


Dates & Location
----------------

The hackathon runs on **July 5, 2026** — the days preceding the [FENS conference](https://fensforum.org/).
It will be held at the Facultat de Medicina of the Universitat de Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain.
